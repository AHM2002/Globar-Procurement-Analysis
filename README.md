## Public Procurement Analyst GPT
Data analytics GPT for automatically analyzing Global Contract-level Public Procurement Dataset

## Inspiration
1. Extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of procurement data can be overwhelming.
2. Many individuals and organizations have access to procurement data and analytical tools but lack the skills or time to leverage them.
3. Transforming raw procurement data into actionable insights remains a challenge.
4. Traditionally, procurement data analysis required either expert knowledge or significant time investment.
5. This limits the ability of stakeholders to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.
6. Most users simply want clear, easy-to-understand insights.
7. They want to analyze procurement data without needing a deep background in analytics.
8. They want to generate standard reports fast.

## What Public Procurement Analyst GPT does
1. Our project, Public Procurement Analyst GPT, simplifies and automates the process of turning raw procurement data into structured, insightful reports.
2. The tool runs the GPT engine of ChatGPT and operates under ChatGPT.
3. The tool automatically analyzes the Global Contract-level Public Procurement Dataset and generates comprehensive annual reports in a very short amount of time.

## Key features include:
1. Automated Report Generation: With just a dataset and minimal interaction, the GPT engine generates a full report, complete with analysis, visual representations, and clear, actionable insights.
2. Visual Data Representation: The reports include graphs, charts, and infographics to make complex procurement data easy to digest.
3. Readily Constructed Prompts: These eliminate the need for users to even think about what analysis is needed.
4. No-code Solution: Easily extendable by anyone.

## How we built it
Sources & Tools used: Science Direct Article - Global Contract-level Public Procurement Dataset, ChatGPT Plus 4.0, Talking.Network for Voice Generation (Emma AI)
1. We dissected all the different analyses in the standard Global Contract-level Public Procurement Dataset report.
2. We constructed the corresponding prompts that would yield the same results as much as possible.
3. We added interactivity to the GPT.
4. We also created new sample data, different from the readily published data.
5. After deploying the GPT under ChatGPT, we tested it extensively.

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating a balance between detailed analysis and simplicity.
- Balancing automation with the need for user interactivity.
- Developing interactivity to enhance user experience.
- Ensuring that ChatGPT adhered to the desired analytical framework without adding its own interpretations.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Built a tool that turns raw procurement data into professional reports in just a few minutes with minimal prompts.
- Delivered a user-friendly no-code solution.
- Enabled data-driven decision-making in public procurement for all users.

## What we learned
- We learned how to strike the right balance between detailed data interpretation and user-friendly design.
- This was our first procurement-focused GPT. We gained valuable insights into GPT development and deployment.

## What's next for Public Procurement Analyst GPT
- Expanding customization options for report generation.
- Enhancing the AIâ€™s ability to provide deeper analysis based on user preferences.
- Exploring more advanced visualizations and complex analyses, including machine learning (ML).
